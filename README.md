# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Neural Networks and Deep Learning Models

## Overview of the analysis:
For this analysis, created a six different supervised machine learning models that could predict credit risks. Following models were used to predict the credit risk.

 * Naive Random Oversampling
 * SMOTE Oversampling
 * Cluster Centroid Undersampling
 * SMOTEENN Sampling
 * Balanced Random Forest Classifying
 * Easy Ensemble Classifying

## Results:
### Data Preprocessing
  * What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

  * What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
  * 
  * What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  * What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
